Master/trunk builds are no longer published. Please use [stable/beta/alpha packages](/download/ "Download"), or [build from source](/developers/building-monodevelop/ "Developers/Building MonoDevelop").

If you build from source, be aware that master builds undergone little or no QA testing. They will likely contain noticeable bugfixes or improvements have been made since the previous release, but may also contain regressions. **Use at your own risk**. If you do run into problems that aren't on the known issues list, please [file bug reports](/Developers "Developers#Reporting_Bugs"). And, as ever, contributions are more than welcome.
