**MonoDevelop 2.2 Beta 2 (2.1.1)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This is the second release of a series of releases that will lead to MonoDevelop 2.2, hopefully in November. This is a bug fix release, so there are no new features since beta 1. Take a look at the [What's new in MonoDevelop 2.2](/documentation/release-notes/whats-new-in-monodevelop-2.2/) page for a detailed description of the features included in the upcoming 2.2 release.

License Change
--------------

Starting in this release, MonoDevelop will be released under the **LGPL 2.1** license instead of GPL 2.0. This change is possible since all the old GPL code has been rewritten or relicensed. The most imporant implication of this change is that from now on MonoDevelop add-ins don't need to be GPL, and add-in authors can use the licence they find more convenient.
