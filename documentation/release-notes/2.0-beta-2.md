**MonoDevelop 2.0 Beta 2 (1.9.3)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This is the last release of a series of releases that will lead to MonoDevelop 2.0. This release contains lots of bug fixes, read below

Installing MonoDevelop
----------------------

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.4
-   Mono.Addins 0.3.1
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   MonoDevelop 2.0 Beta 2 Source

**It is highly recommended to use the latest versions of Mono and Gtk#.**

You can download MonoDevelop 2.0 Beta 2 source from [here](/download/). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 2.0 to run.

### Installing Add-ins

There are some add-ins which are distributed as separate packages. Those packages are:

-   monodevelop-boo: Boo language binding.
-   monodevelop-java: Java language binding (with IKVM).
-   monodevelop-database: database management add-in.
-   monodevelop-vala: Vala language add-in.
-   monodevelop-debugger-mdb: Mono debugger support.

Thanks

To all of our wonderful testers, who had the patience to use unstable versions of MonoDevelop for everyday use, and managed to post nice bug reports.

To Mike Krüger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

To Pedro Abelleira, Todd Berman, John Luke, and other early contributors who started this adventure 5 years ago, and who believed in the feasibility of the project.

To all of the active and not so active (we miss you!) MonoDevelop developers.
