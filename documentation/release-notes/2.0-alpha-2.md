**MonoDevelop 2.0 Alpha 2 (1.9.1)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This is the second release of a series of releases that will lead to MonoDevelop 2.0, hopefully around the end of the year. This release contains lots of new features and improvements. Read below.

Installing MonoDevelop
----------------------

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Mono.Addins 0.3.1
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   MonoDevelop 2.0 Alpha 2 Source

**It is highly recommended to use Gtk# 2.8.4 or later, since it includes important memory use and performance improvements.**

You can download MonoDevelop 2.0 Alpha 2 source from [here](/download/). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 2.0 to run.

### Installing Add-ins

There are some add-ins which are distributed as separate packages. Those packages are:

-   monodevelop-boo: Boo language binding.
-   monodevelop-java: Java language binding (with IKVM).
-   monodevelop-database: database management add-in.
-   monodevelop-vala: Vala language add-in.
-   monodevelop-debugger-mdb: Mono debugger support.
-   monodevelop-debugger-gdb: Native debugger support with GDB.

Other add-ins are available using the MonoDevelop Add-in Manager (in the Tools menu, click on 'Add-in Manager' and then on 'Install Add-ins').

New Features and Improvements
-----------------------------

### Integrated Debugger

This is the first MonoDevelop release that includes support for debugging. There is support for two debuggers: **MDB** (the Mono debugger, which allows debugging managed applications), and **GDB** (which allows debugging native applications).

Here is a list of the supported features (not all features are supported in both debuggers):

-   Step by step debugging.
-   Variable and field value inspection, with support for drill-down, and value editing (with code completion).
-   Process Attach/Detach (only GDB).
-   Disassembly view, mixed with source code view when available.
-   Call stack and threads window.
-   Debug tooltip in the editor. It shows the value of variables in a tooltip, with support for drill-down and value editing.
-   Expression evaluator.
-   Support for breakpoints. Adding, removing, enabling, disabling.
-   Tracepoints, hitpoints, and conditional breakpoints (currently only working in GDB).

### Web Development

MonoDevelop's ASP.NET web projects are now compatible with Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Web Developer 2008 SP1.

The reliability and performance of the ASP.NET source editor and code completion is much improved.

CodeBehind partial designer classes are now updated only if needed, improving build time.

HTML code completion is now available for HTML files as well as ASP.NET documents.

Preliminary support for Moonlight 2.0 is available. Projects can be created, edited and saved, and a limited amount of XAML code completion is enabled. The projects are compatible with Visual Studio's Silverlight 2 projects. However, building and running of these projects is not yet implemented.

(Michael Hutchinson)

### Source Code Editing

#### C# Code Completion Improvements

Code completion support has been greatly improved. The completion window is now shown in all contexts. It is shown when typing the first char of an identifier, and it will include all valid types, members and keywords.

There are also other improvements, such as automatic generation of event handlers or anonymous methods when subscribing an event (see image).

(Mike Krüger).

#### C# 3 Support

The C# parser has been upgraded to support C# 3. Some constructs (but not all) are already supported by code completion, such as extension methods (Mike Krüger).

#### vi Modes Support

The editor now includes vi modes support, supporting many common vi commands: $^0wRruIiOoPp{}AaDdGhjklXxCcVvbNn\<\>:?/ (Michael Hutchinson, Levi Bard).

#### Document Outline pad

The Document Outline pad is now functional for C# source files (and other other .NET source files with MonoDevelop parsers), enabling easy navigation of classes and members in the current file (Michael Hutchinson).

<h3>Encapsulate Field Dialog</h3>

### Version Control

Version Control support has been improved with some new features:

-   Added support for locking/unlocking files.
-   Implemented support for the Resolve Subversion command.
-   Implemented support for the Revert to Revision command.

(Lluis Sanchez, Andrés Aragoneses)

### Gtk# Visual Designer

There are some improvements in the Gtk# Visual Designer:

-   Custom widgets can now easily be made available in the toolbox by just applying a [ToolboxItem] attribute to the class.
-   Designed windows and dialogs now expose a private Gtk.UIManager field to get access to the action based UI elements.

To all of our wonderful testers, who had the patience to use unstable versions of MonoDevelop for everyday use, and managed to post nice bug reports.

To Mike Krüger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

To Pedro Abelleira, Todd Berman, John Luke, and other early contributors who started this adventure 4 years ago, and who believed in the feasibility of the project.

To all of the active and not so active (we miss you!) MonoDevelop developers.
