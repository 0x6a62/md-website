**MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta 2 (0.17)** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This release contains lots of bug fixes, some new features and improvements. Read below.

### Installing MonoDevelop

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.8.0
-   Gtksourceview\#-2.0 0.10
-   Monodoc 1.0
-   Gecko\#-2.0 0.10
-   MonoDevelop 0.17 Source

**It is highly recommended to use Gtk# 2.8.4, since it includes important memory use and performance improvements.**

You can download MonoDevelop 1.0 Beta 2 source from [here](/download/ "Download"). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

### New Features and Improvements

This release is mainly focused on bug fixing, but there are also some new features and improvements.

#### Deployment of ASP.NET projects

ASP.NET projects can now be deployed to local directories using the new Web Deploy command. If the FUSE "sshfs" filesystem is available, it can be used to deploy projects to remote servers. (Michael Hutchinson).

#### Support for VS 2005 Web Application projects

MonoDevelop can now open Web Application projects created with Visual Studio 2005. Projects can be built and tested with XSP. (Ankit Jain).

#### ASP.NET Codebehind Generation Improvements

The existing support for auto-generating and verifying CodeBehind members for ASP.NET files is much improved. It handles more kinds of controls, features type/member compatibility resolution and has better error reporting. (Michael Hutchinson).

#### Generation of Satellite Assemblies

Added support for generating Satellite Assemblies for localized resources. (Ankit Jain).

#### Makefile generation improvements

Custom build commands defined in a project will now be included in the Makefiles generated using the Generate Makefiles command. Also, special targets in the generated makefiles have pre/post hooks now. (Ankit Jain).

#### Other IDE improvements

-   **Configurable toolbar size**. The size of the main MonoDevelop toolbar is now configurable, and can be set to a small size better suited for small resolutions (Mike Krüeger).
-   The new **Show Scrollbars** property in the designer makes it easy to wrap a widget with a ScrolledWindow (Lluis Sanchez).
-   **New project and file icons**. The style of all file and project icons has been unified (Lluis Sanchez).
-   **Improved Project Features dialog**. The dialog shown when creating a project has been improved, and now provides more information about features you can set on a new project (Lluis Sanchez).

### Thanks

All of our wonderful testers who put up with the insane dependencies, the constant breakage and still managed to post nice bug reports.

Mike Krueger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

All of the active MonoDevelop developers.
