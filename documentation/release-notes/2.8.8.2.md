Here's the list of bugs and other issues fixed since the 2.8.8.1Â beta release:

-   Opening a Solution expands the Solution tree-view like it used to in all previous versions
-   Implemented iPad Retina launch image & icon selectors in the Plist editor
-   Prevent stack overflow decoding non-generic types with \` in the name (bug \#3714)
-   Don't enable the Continue command if we aren't paused (bug \#3713 - this only happens if the app crashes or there is a bug in the runtime)
-   Prevent infinite loop in parsing generic type names (fixes bugs like \#3778 and \#3794)
-   Possible fix for ProjectDom race when syncing out to Xcode (the infamous "Xcode doesn't show any header files for my xibs" bug)
-   Fixed resolving breakpoints inside anonymous delegates (bug \#3544)
-   Fixed \*AdjustLine\* methods to not Remove and then re-Add bp's (should fix bug \#3590 which was a race condition)
-   Version control related fixes, bugs \#3795, \#3854, \#3855.
