**MonoDevelop 0.11** has been released. MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

This release is mainly a bug fix release, although there are also some interesting new features. Read below.

### Installing MonoDevelop

#### MonoDevelop Dependencies

Compiling the following order will yield the most favorable response.

-   Gtk# 2.4.0
-   Gtksourceview\#-2.0 0.10
-   Monodoc 1.0 (requires gtk-sharp 1.0)
-   Gecko\#-2.0 0.10
-   MonoDevelop 0.11 Source

You can download MonoDevelop 0.11 source from [here](/download/). The Mono download site contains packages for everything for many popular distros. You can also check the mono redcarpet channel.

This release of MonoDevelop needs at least Mono 1.1.10 to run.

### New Features

#### Compilation support for .NET 2.0

MonoDevelop now supports compilation of assemblies using the 2.0 runtime and libraries. However, code completion for C# 2.0 is not yet supported, and may stop working for files wich contain C# 2.0 syntax (such as generics or anonymous delegates).

There is a new option panel in the project options dialog which can be used to select the target runtime of the project. It looks like this:

#### Open File dialog filtering

MonoDevelop's Open File dialog now supports filtering by common file extensions. Add-ins can define new extensions and file types to be added in the dialog.

### Bug Fixes

There are many bug fixes in this release. Here are some of them:

-   Nullref in the GUI designer property editor in some themes.
-   Monodevelop freezes on removing and then adding a page from/to a notebook using Stetic.
-   Several fixes in code generation for GtkFrame, Gtk.Expander, Gtk.Scale, Gtk.Scrollbar, Gtk.Button.
-   Unhandled exception when creating/renaming a directory in the "Solution" tab.
-   Save solution preferences in the actual solution directory.
-   Autocompletion stops working when a delegate is declared in a C# class.
-   Crash or hang in the designer when creating a table with less than 3 rows.
-   Window title not updated in the designer.
-   Widget names may be duplicated by automatically created widgets (such as Alignment & Label by Frame) are by Copy&Paste operations.

### API and implementation changes

Implemented a command line tool for dumping the whole extension tree in an xml file, from which documentation can be generated. The tool can be executed like this: "mdtool dump-addin-tree \<name-of-addin\>".

### Thanks

All of our wonderful testers who put up with the insane dependencies, the constant breakage and still managed to post nice bug reports.

Mike Krueger and the rest of the AlphaSierraPapa team for giving us a great codebase to start from, and continuing improvements.

All of the active MonoDevelop developers.
