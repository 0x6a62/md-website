Building MonoDevelop
--------------------

#### Development: Getting Started

[Read Article](/developers/articles/development-getting-started/ "Developers/Articles/Development: Getting Started"). It's relatively easy to get started working on MonoDevelop, but this article aims to make it easier to get off the ground.

#### Environment Variables

[Read Article](/developers/articles/environment-variables/ "Developers/Articles/Environment_Variables"). An in-depth explanation of all environment variables that can be altered in order to simplify the development of MonoDevelop. 

#### Building MonoDevelop from source

[Read Article](/developers/building-monodevelop/). Basic steps for building MonoDevelop. 

Writing Add-ins
---------------

#### Creating a Simple Add-in

[This walkthrough](/developers/articles/creating-a-simple-add-in/ "Developers/Articles/Creating a Simple Add-in") will guide you through the process of creating a simple add-in, introducing the fundamentals of the add-in system and some of MonoDevelop's core APIs.

#### Walk through: Extending the Project Pad

[Read Article](/developers/articles/extending-the-project-pad/ "Developers/Articles/Extending_the_Project_Pad"). This tutorial explains how to implement an addin that extends the project pad. The idea for this extension is to be able to show the classes that are implemented in a file as child nodes of that file in the project pad.

#### How to extend the Project Model

[Read Article](/developers/articles/how-to-extend-the-project-model/ "Developers/Articles/How_to_extend_the_Project_Model"). This article explains how to extend the project model to support new types of projects or to add additional information to existing project types.

#### Syntax mode definition

[Read Article](/developers/articles/syntax-mode-definition/ "Developers/Articles/Syntax Mode Definition"). This article explains how to create a syntax hilighting mode for a new file type.

#### Editor color sheme definition 

[Read Article](/developers/articles/color-sheme-definition/ "Developers/Articles/Color Sheme Definition"). This article explains how to create a syntax hilighting mode for a new file type.

Publishing an Add-in

[Read Article](/developers/articles/publishing-an-addin/ "Developers/Articles/Publishing an Addin"). This article explains how to publish an add-in to make it available to MonoDevelop users.

#### Introduction to Mono.Addins

[Read Article](http://www.mono-project.com/Introduction_to_Mono.Addins "http://www.mono-project.com/Introduction_to_Mono.Addins"). This article explains the library basics and some examples. Mono.Addins is the add-in engine used by MonoDevelop.

#### Mono.Addins Reference Manual

[Read Article](http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Addins_Reference_Manual "http://www.mono-project.com/Mono.Addins_Reference_Manual"). An in-depth explanation of all Mono.Addins features. Mono.Addins is the add-in engine used by MonoDevelop.

MonoDevelop API
---------------

#### API Overview

[Read Article](/developers/articles/api-overview/ "Developers/Articles/API Overview"). An overview of the MonoDevelop API, explaining where to find the most important services and how to use them.

#### Using the Data Serializer

[Read Article](/developers/articles/using-the-data-serializer/ "Developers/Articles/Using The Data Serializer"). A programming guide of the generic data serializer provided by the MonoDevelop API.

#### The String Parser Service

[Read Article](/developers/articles/the-string-parser-service/ "Developers/Articles/The String Parser Service"). A programming guide for the String Parser Service.

#### Logging

[Read Article](/developers/articles/logging/ "Developers/Articles/Logging"). MonoDevelop's logging service provides a configurable way for developers to log debug and error messages reported by Addins.

MonoDevelop Design and Architecure
----------------------------------

#### Architecture Overview

[Read Article](/developers/articles/architecture-overview/ "Developers/Articles/Architecture_Overview"). This document is an overview of the new assembly organization of MonoDevelop.

#### Add-in Extension Tree Reference

[Read Article](/developers/articles/extension-tree-reference/ "Developers/Articles/Extension_Tree_Reference"). This document shows the complete extension tree available to add-in developers.

#### The Command System

[Read Article](/developers/articles/the-command-system/ "Developers/Articles/The_Command_System"). This article explains how MonoDevelop's Command System works, and how can you take advantage of it for writing your add-ins.

#### Thread Management in MonoDevelop

[Read Article](/developers/articles/thread-management/ "Developers/Articles/Thread_Management"). This article explains the some basic rules that every addin developer should follow regarding thread management in MonoDevelop.

#### Translations

[Read Article](/developers/articles/translations/ "Developers/Articles/Translations"). MonoDevelop has chosen to use gettext instead of resources for translating into other languages. This allows us to take advantage of GNOME translators' familiarity with gettext.

#### Refactoring

[Read Article](/developers/articles/refactoring/ "Developers/Articles/Refactoring"). This article explains the MonoDevelop refactoring infrastructure. It helps writing own refactorings.

#### Designer Infrastructure

MonoDevelop has some infrastructure for supporting visual designers, such as the ASP.NET and Gtk# designers. Some of this — the property grid and toolbox — is now being used elsewhere in MonoDevelop.

There is an article on the [Toolbox](/developers/articles/toolbox/ "Developers/Articles/Toolbox").
